The module vendor_name is Brjupo_CorporateGroup

Instructions:
1.- Create corporate group entity, it should had the following
- entity_id
- corporate group identifier

- corporate group contact telephone

2.- Customer can belong to one corporate group
- link customer to corporate group

3.- Create and expose a web api to allow fetch, create, delete & search corporate groups




Solution:
1.- Please refer to app/code/Brjupo/CorporateGroup/etc/db_schema.xml
